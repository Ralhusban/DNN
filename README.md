# Deen Neural Network from scratch using vectorization

In this project, we construct a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the following specifications: 

- Code written from scratch e.g. no use of Keras / tensor flow etc
- The function will accept any number of hidden layers and hidden units at each layer
- L2 weight regularization is applied if indicated in the parameters
- We test our DNN's performance on the MINST dataset and plot performance metrics that include training and validation accuracy and loss.
